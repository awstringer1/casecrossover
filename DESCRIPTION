Description: Implementation of the methodology described in ...
    This package fits case crossover models with linear or smooth terms
    for covariate effects, using approximate Bayesian inference. Marginal
    posterior summaries are returned by default, and functions are provided
    for more advanced computations like global confidence envelopes and samples.
